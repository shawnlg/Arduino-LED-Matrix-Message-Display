# Arduino-LED-Matrix-Message-Display
This sketch allows you to wire up an 8x8 LED matrix without knowing which pins are for what.  An easy config will guide you through setting up the display.  Then you can enter and display messages on the matrix.  No external components are needed besides the matrix and Arduino.
